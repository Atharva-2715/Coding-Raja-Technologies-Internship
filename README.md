I am Atharva Sakpal and I have made this repository to store my tasks. These tasks were assigned by Coding Raja Technologies as part of my 1-month internship program.
This repository consists of two tasks which are :
1) To-Do List application = This task comprises of two files named "todo_list.py" and "data.txt". It is an simple application made so that the users can remove or add tasks as per their convenience.
2) Budget Tracker = This task comprises of files named "budget_tracker.py" and "expenses.txt". It is an application to help the users keep track of their expenses and be able to see the summary of their expenses whenever they want.
